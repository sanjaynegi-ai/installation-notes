# Anaconda – Beginner Notes 🐍📦

## What is Anaconda?

**Anaconda** is an all-in-one tool that makes working with Python simple, especially for beginners. Instead of installing Python and many libraries separately, Anaconda installs everything at once. It comes with Python, commonly used libraries, and tools like **Jupyter Notebook** and **JupyterLab**, which allow you to write and run Python code in a web browser.

Anaconda also includes **Conda**, a package and environment manager that helps you install libraries and manage different projects without conflicts.
